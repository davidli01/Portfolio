						I'm David Li, car and computer enthusiast. Born and raised in New York City. I graduated from Lincoln Technical Institute with the Automotive Technologies degree. After working at Audi for a short time, I realize I want more education; but this time I wanted to advance my studies in computer technologies. I pursued my computer desires at Pennsylvania State University, my intended degree was Security and Risk Analysis/Cybersecurity. Along my first semester I came across an ad for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp on facebook, it caught my attention. Coding! This is meant for me! Without further ado, immediately I applied with no hesitation. It's the things in life that you can't explain; gets you furthest and most successful. For those that are interested in my past before the above, I will sum up four years of my life in one sentence. At the age of 18 I enlisted in the US Army for 4 years, MOS 31B; trained in Fort Leonardwood, Missouri.

						On my free time, I like to eat. I mean who doesn't, its the perfect remedy for stress and bordem. I don't just consume everything I see in my path, I have strict eating habits. Mentally I have a low sugar intake quota, and a high water intake quota; I like to taste food from all over the world, what better place to do that than in New York City. Occassionally I would spend my free time playing pool and chess.
